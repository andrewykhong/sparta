<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Create or reset or remove a custom attribute for particles, grid
cells, or surface elements.  To create or reset an attribute, the
<I>set</I> or <I>file</I> action is specified.  For <I>set</I>, a variable is
evaluated.  For <I>file</I>, a file is read which contains values for
individual grid cells or surface elements.  Particle-style attributes
cannot be reset with the <I>file</I> action.
</P>
<P>Custom attributes can be vectors (single value per entity) or arrays
(mutiple values per entity).  They can also be integer or floating
point values.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_17">Section 6.17</A> for more
discussion of custom attributes.
</P>
<P>The <I>style</I> setting is <I>particle</I> or <I>grid</I> or <I>surf</I> for custom
per-particle, per-grid, or per-surf attributes.
</P>
<P>The <I>attribute</I> setting specifies the name of the attribute to operate
on.  The same name can be used for attributes of different styles.
E.g. there can be a custom attribute with the name "flag" for both
particles and surface elements.  If the attribute name is specified
without brackets, it can refer to a custom vector or array.  If the
attribute name is specified with a bracketed integer, it refers to a
single column of a custom array.  The integer <I>N</I> must be between 1
and M = # of columns in the array (values per entity).  See the <I>size</I>
keyword discussion below for how to specify M if it is a new custom
array.
</P>
<P>The <I>action</I> setting is <I>set</I> or <I>file</I> or <I>remove</I>.
</P>
<P>If <I>remove</I> is used, then the <I>attribute</I> should be simply the name of
the attribute, whether it is a vector or array.  No trailing brackets
are specified.  The attribute will be removed from the system.  No
further arguments can be specified.
</P>
<P>If <I>set</I> or <I>file</I> is used, then the attribute is created if it does
not already exist and its values are initialized to zero.  Note that
the optional <I>type</I> and <I>size</I> keywords discussed below can affect
what kind of attribute is created.
</P>
<HR>

<P>If <I>set</I> is used as the action, a variable is used to reset values of
the custom attribute.  This action can only be used to operate on a
custom vector or a single column of a custom array (using a bracketed
integer).
</P>
<P>The specified <I>v_name</I> is the name of a the variable which is
evaluated.  It must be either an equal-style or particle-style or
grid-style or surf-style variable.  All of these define a mathematical
formula which is used to compute the value(s) of the variable.  See
the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> for details.
</P>
<P>If an equal-style variable is specified, it produces a single value
which will be assigned as the custom value to all the particles or
grid cells or surface elements (see subset-ID and region-ID discussion
below).  Otherwise a particle-style variable must be used for style =
<I>particle</I>, a grid-style variable for style = <I>grid</I>, or a surf-style
variable for style = <I>surf</I>.  When it is evaluated it generates one
value for each particle, grid cell, or surface element, which is
assigned to the custom vector or to a column of the custom array.
</P>
<P>Note that the latter 3 variable styles can include outputs from
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> or <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> commands.  They can also
include the current timestep or the spatial position of a particle,
grid cell, or surface element in their formula. So it is easy to
calculate a value for each entity which varies in time or spatially.
</P>
<P>The next two arguments, <I>subset-ID</I> and <I>region-ID</I>, can limit which
particles, grid cells, or surface elements are assigned a custom
value.  An individual particle, grid cell, or surface element must
meet both criteria to have its custom value set, otherwise its value
is unchanged.
</P>
<P>The <I>subset-ID</I> is the ID of a mixture for particles or the ID of a
group of grid cells or surface elements.  Only particles in the
mixture or grid cells/surface elements in the group will be assigned a
value.  See the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> and <A HREF = "group.html">group</A> commands
for more details.  Note that "all" is a pre-defined mixture ID which
contains all particles.  Likewise "all" is the name of a pre-defined
group with all grid cells or all surface elements.
</P>
<P>The <I>region-ID</I> is the ID of a geometric region defined by the
<A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command.  Only particles or grid cells or surface
elements in the region will have their values set.  The center point
of a grid cell or surface element is used for the region check.  If
<I>region-ID</I> is specified as NULL, then the region criterion is not
applied.
</P>
<HR>

<P>If <I>file</I> is used as the action, a file with name <I>fname</I> is read to
reset values of the custom attribute.  This action can only be used
with custom attributes of style <I>grid</I> or <I>surf</I>; it cannot be used
with custom attributes of style <I>particle</I>.
</P>
<P>If the specified custom attribute is a vector or a single column of an
array (bracketed integer), then the file must contain a single value
for each grid cell or surface element.  If the custom attribute is an
array (with no bracketed integer), then the file must contain M values
for each grid cell or suface element, where M is the number of columns
in the array.
</P>
<P>The format of the file is as follows.  Note that the number of
attributes specified in the file does not have to equal the number of
grid cells or surface elements.  If the ID of a grid cell or surface
element does not appear in the file, then its custom attribute
value(s) will be unchanged.
</P>
<P>The file can start with any number of commented or blank lines.
A commented line starts with the "#" character.
</P>
<P>The first non-comment, non-blank line must be an integer count N of
the number of remaining attribute value lines in the file.  These N
lines must immediately follow the count line and contain no blank lines.
Any remaining lines are no ignored.
</P>
<P>The format of each attribute value line is as follows:
</P>
<P>ID value1 value2 ...
</P>
<P>ID is the integer ID of the grid cell or surface element.  Note that
for hierarchial grids, it must be the integer form of the ID, not the
string form.  One or more values follow, depending on the attribute
was specified.  If it is a vector or a bracketed integer was appended,
then only value1 should be listed.  If it is an array with M columns,
then M values should be listed.
</P>
<P>The following is an example of a correctly formatted file to set the
values for a per-surface custom array with 2 columns.  Only the
values for 3 surface elements are set.
</P>
<PRE># custom values for a few surface elements
# calculated for test problem XYZ

<HR>

<P>Two optional keywords affect the creation of a new custom vector or
array.  They are ignored if the custom vector or array already exists.
</P>
<P>The <I>type</I> keyword can be used with <I>int</I> or <I>float</I> as its arg.  The
created custom attribute will then store either integer or
floating-point values.  Floating point values are the default.
</P>
<P>The <I>size</I> keyword can be used with arg = 0 to create a custom vector
(which is the default).  It can also be used with an arg M >= 1 to
create an array with M columns (values per entity).  This means that
if a new <I>attribute</I> name is specified with no brackets and the <I>size</I>
keyword is not used, a vector will be created.  If the size keyword is
used with arg >= 1, then an array will be created.  If the new
<I>attribute</I> name has a bracketed integer, then it must be <= arg.
