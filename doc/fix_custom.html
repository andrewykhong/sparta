<P><B>Syntax:</B>

<PRE>fix ID custom Nfreq style attribute action args ... style attribute action args ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID is documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command 

<LI>custom = style name of this fix command 

<LI>Nfreq = reset custom values every this many steps 

<LI>style = <I>particle</I> or <I>grid</I> or <I>surf</I>

<PRE>  name = custom vector or array attribute with name

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Reset one or more custom attributes for particles, grid cells, or
surface elements.  This operation is performed once every <I>Nfreq</I>
timesteps.  For a <I>set</I> action, a variable is evaluated.  For a <I>file</I>
action, a file is read which contains values for individual grid cells
or surface elements.  Particle-style attributes cannot be reset with
the <I>file</I> action.
</P>
<P>Custom attributes can be vectors (single value per entity) or arrays
(mutiple values per entity).  They can also be integer or floating
point values.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_17">Section 6.17</A> for more
discussion of custom attributes.
</P>
<P>Each <I>style</I> setting is <I>particle</I> or <I>grid</I> or <I>surf</I> for custom
per-particle, per-grid, or per-surf attributes.
</P>
<P>Each <I>attribute</I> setting specifies the name of the attribute to
operate on.  The same name can be used for attributes of different
styles.  E.g. there can be a custom attribute with the name "flag" for
both particles and surface elements.  If the attribute name is
specified without brackets, it can refer to a custom vector or array.
If the attribute name is specified with a bracketed integer, it refers
to a single column of a custom array.  The integer <I>N</I> must be between
1 and M = # of columns in the array (values per entity)
</P>
<P>Each <I>action</I> setting is <I>set</I> or <I>file</I>.
</P>
<P>Note that the resetting of attributes by this fix takes place at the
end of timesteps determined by <I>Nfreq</I>.  If custom attributes are
output by a <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command on the same timestep, that takes
place after this fix has performed the reset.  This means that if this
fix and a dump command both reset/output every 1000 steps, then a dump
file snapshot for step 3000 will include custom attributes which were
reset at the end of step 3000.  But the new attribute values will not
influence particles or grid cells or surface elements until the
following step 3001 and beyond.
</P>
<P>Also note that this command DOES NOT reset attribute values at the
beginning of any run, even if an input script contains multiple
<A HREF = "run.html">run</A> commands.  For example, if <I>Nfreq</I> = 1000 and the input
script performs a series of 10000-step runs, then no resetting of
attributes takes place (due to this command) on timestep 0, before the
first run.  If needed, this can be done using the <A HREF = "custom.html">custom</A>
command before the first run.
</P>
<P>Likewise, between runs, this command DOES reset attribute values at
the end of the last step (10000, 20000, etc) of each run, but DOES NOT
reset them again before the first step of the next run.  If needed,
this can be done using the <A HREF = "custom.html">custom</A> command in between
runs to reset attribute values as desired.
</P>
<HR>

<P>If <I>set</I> is used as an action, a variable is used to reset values of
the custom attribute.  This action can only be used to operate on a
custom vector or a single column of a custom array (using a bracketed
integer).
</P>
<P>The specified <I>v_name</I> is the name of a variable which is evaluated.
It must be either an equal-style or particle-style or grid-style or
surf-style variable.  All of these define a mathematical formula which
is used to compute the value(s) of the variable.  See the
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> for details.
</P>
<P>If an equal-style variable is specified, it produces a single value
which will be assigned as the custom value to all the particles or
grid cells or surface elements (see subset-ID and region-ID discussion
below).  Otherwise a particle-style variable must be used for style =
<I>particle</I>, a grid-style variable for style = <I>grid</I>, or a surf-style
variable for style = <I>surf</I>.  When it is evaluated it generates one
value for each particle, grid cell, or surface element, which is
assigned to the custom vector or to a column of the custom array.
</P>
<P>Note that the latter 3 variable styles can include outputs from
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> or <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> commands.  They can also
include the current timestep or the spatial position of a particle,
grid cell, or surface element in their formula.  So it is easy to
calculate a value for each entity which varies in time or spatially.
Note that the variable formula can also include a reference to the
custom attribute it is overwrting, which means the remainder of the
formula can increment/decrement or scale the current attribute value.
</P>
<P>The next two arguments, <I>subset-ID</I> and <I>region-ID</I>, can limit which
particles, grid cells, or surface elements are assigned a custom
value.  An individual particle, grid cell, or surface element must
meet both criteria to have its custom value set, otherwise its value
is unchanged.
</P>
<P>The <I>subset-ID</I> is the ID of a mixture for particles or the ID of a
group of grid cells or surface elements.  Only particles in the
mixture or grid cells/surface elements in the group will be assigned a
value.  See the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> and <A HREF = "group.html">group</A> commands
for more details.  Note that "all" is a pre-defined mixture ID which
contains all particles.  Likewise "all" is the name of a pre-defined
group with all grid cells or all surface elements.
</P>
<P>The <I>region-ID</I> is the ID of a geometric region defined by the
<A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command.  Only particles or grid cells or surface
elements in the region will have their values set.  The center point
of a grid cell or surface element is used for the region check.  If
<I>region-ID</I> is specified as NULL, then the region criterion is not
applied.
</P>
<HR>

<P>If <I>file</I> is used as an action, a file with name <I>fname</I> is read to
reset values of the custom attribute.  This action can only be used
with custom attributes of style <I>grid</I> or <I>surf</I>; it cannot be used
with custom attributes of style <I>particle</I>.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>fname</I> must contain a "*" character which is replaced
by the current timestep each time this fix is invoked.  For example,
if <I>Nfreq</I> = 1000 and <I>fname</I> is specified as surf.*.attribute, then
then files surf.1000.attribute, surf.2000.attribute,
surf.3000.attribute, etc will be read on timesteps 1000, 2000, 3000,
etc.
</P>
<P>If the specified custom attribute is a vector or a single column of an
array (bracketed integer), then the file must contain a single value
for each grid cell or surface element.  If the custom attribute is an
array (with no bracketed integer), then the file must contain M values
for each grid cell or suface element, where M is the number of columns
in the array.
</P>
<P>The format of each file is identical to the file format explained on
the "custom" command doc page for use with a <I>file</I> action.
